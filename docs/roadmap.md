This roadmap reflects current priorities. Items may shift as the project evolves.

## Short term

- Permission model or allowlist for tool execution
- Tool execution sandboxing
- Improved error reporting and observability
- More robust web fetch parsing

## Mid term

- Parallel tool execution within a single turn
- Optional streaming responses
- Better group mention detection and quoting
- Optional web UI console
- Sub-agent orchestration hardening (task contracts, timeout/cancel controls, and clearer result shaping)

## Long term

- Multimodal input (images, documents)
- Pluggable tool marketplace
- Multi-agent orchestration

## Sub-agent track

- Now: keep the current `sub_agent` tool stable and constrained (no recursive side effects, explicit boundaries)
- Next: improve parent/child task handoff with stricter input/output contracts and better recovery on malformed tool calls
- Later: expand from single delegated worker into broader multi-agent orchestration workflows
