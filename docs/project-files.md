This repository includes several reference documents used by developers and AI assistants.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Overview, setup, and user-facing documentation |
| `DEVELOP.md` | Developer guide for contributors |
| `TEST.md` | Manual testing checklist |
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI assistant project context |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent-focused architecture and tool reference |

These files inform both repository docs and website documentation. Use GitHub Releases for version-by-version change history.
