MCP extends tool surface area without baking all integrations into MicroClaw itself.

## Transport model

Supported transports:

- `stdio`
- `streamable_http`

Protocol version is negotiated during initialize (default currently `2025-11-05`, configurable per server/global).

## Reliability model

- request timeout (`request_timeout_secs`)
- retry + reconnect for stdio (`max_retries`)
- tools cache with TTL + forced refresh
- periodic health probe (`health_interval_secs`, `0` disables)

## Tool exposure

MCP tools are registered into the same runtime tool registry with namespaced identifiers.
This keeps planner behavior consistent between built-in tools and MCP tools.

Additionally, MicroClaw can use MCP as a structured-memory backend when a server exposes:

- `memory_query`
- `memory_upsert`

In that mode, memory operations become MCP-first with automatic fallback to local SQLite on per-call failures.

Minimal config sketch:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "transport": "streamable_http",
      "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:8090/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

This server is considered memory-capable only when it exposes both `memory_query` and `memory_upsert`.

## Operational guidance

- Start with minimal local MCP config.
- Add remote servers one-by-one.
- Monitor tool list refresh and probe failures in logs.
- Treat endpoint auth and command dependencies as first-class operational dependencies.
