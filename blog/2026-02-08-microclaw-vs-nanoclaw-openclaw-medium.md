If you are building a personal AI assistant around chat, you usually choose among three distinct paths:

1. Minimal and isolation-first
2. Broad platform with high feature surface
3. Balanced runtime with practical built-ins

This comparison is updated using publicly available docs/repos as of **February 14, 2026**.

## TL;DR

- **NanoClaw**: best when minimal code surface and container isolation are the top priorities.
- **OpenClaw**: best when you need wide channel/platform coverage with control-plane breadth.
- **MicroClaw**: best when you want a practical middle path with durable state and maintainable complexity.

## At a Glance (Updated)

| Dimension | NanoClaw | OpenClaw | MicroClaw |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orientation | Minimal, skill-first, single-user customization | Personal AI platform with broad channel + node ecosystem | Practical chat runtime, Telegram-first with shared core |
| Runtime stack | Node.js + Claude Agent SDK + containers | TypeScript/Node.js control plane + multi-surface stack | Rust + Tokio + unified agent engine |
| Channel stance | WhatsApp-first base | Broad native + extension channels | Telegram-first, plus Discord/Web and optional expansions |
| Extensibility style | Prefer skills that transform forked code | Platform modules, tools, nodes, apps, and ecosystem surfaces | Built-in tools + skills + sub-agent composition |
| Session and memory | Simpler base persistence model | Platform-level session/routing model | Durable sessions + context compaction + layered memory |
| Security emphasis | OS-level isolation by default | Policy/pairing/allowlist controls in gateway model | App-level authorization + hardening path |
| Ops complexity | Low-to-moderate | Highest (in exchange for capability breadth) | Moderate (feature-rich, but loop architecture remains focused) |

## Notable Public Signals (as of 2026-02-14)

- NanoClaw README now foregrounds **Agent Swarms** and keeps a strong skill-first philosophy.
- OpenClaw README/docs continue expanding multi-channel, node, voice, and canvas workflows.
- MicroClaw remains focused on the mid-complexity runtime space: robust agent loop, durable state, and practical operational features.

## Choosing by Use Case

### Choose NanoClaw if

- You want the smallest understandable base and plan to customize by code transformation skills.
- You prioritize container-isolation defaults over broad built-in surfaces.

### Choose OpenClaw if

- You want the widest integrated platform: many channels, nodes, voice, canvas, and gateway tooling.
- You accept higher operational and configuration complexity for that breadth.

### Choose MicroClaw if

- Telegram-centric workflows are your immediate priority.
- You want strong session continuity, memory quality, tool orchestration, and scheduler support without adopting the largest platform footprint.

## Final Take

This is not a winner-take-all ranking. It is a complexity-placement decision:

- NanoClaw: complexity pushed into fork customization
- OpenClaw: complexity pushed into platform breadth
- MicroClaw: complexity concentrated on high-frequency runtime features

Pick the one that matches your operations budget and workflow style.
